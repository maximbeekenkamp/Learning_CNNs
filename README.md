A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn to distinguish among the CIFAR-10 dataset.
The goal of this project is to learn how a CNN is implemented in tensorflow, and subsequently
create personal implementations of their model features whilst maintaining accuracy. For this 
model the achieved accuracy is 61.04%. There are no known bugs.
